# A-BETA: Fully Automated Earthquake Catalog Replenishment Tool

## Overview

**A-BETA (Auto-Biscale Empirical Transformation Application)** is a fully automated tool for replenishing incomplete earthquake catalogs, enhancing seismological analysis by addressing missing early aftershock data. This repository contains the Python implementation and sample datasets for the method described in our paper, currently under review at *Seismological Research Letters* (SRL).
